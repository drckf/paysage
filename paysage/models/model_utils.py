Comments for drckf:

A deep boltzmann machine typically has a structure like:

L_0 : W_0 : L_1 : W_1 : L_2 ~ layer : weight : layer : weight : layer

the connectivity can be represented by a graph where the layers are "verticies"
and the weights are "edges". below, i put quotation marks around the usual
graph theory terms

the "adjacency matrix" for the layers is:
     L_0 L_1 L_2
L_0: 0   1   0
L_1: 1   0   1
L_2: 0   1   0

so that the layer connections (i.e., the "adjacency list") are:
0: [1]
1: [0, 2]
2: [1]

notice that if the adjacency matrix is A then the connections of layer i
are given by A[i].nonzero() (works for both numpy and torch tensors -- though,
they return slightly different objects so need a backend function to standardize
the result).

the "unoriented incidence matrix" of the graph is:
     W_0 W_1
L_0: 1   0
L_1: 1   1
L_2: 0   1

the weight connections (i.e., the "edge list") are:
0: [0, 1]
1: [1, 2]

Thoughts:

"Gradient Clamping" seems like a natural thing to put in the layer itself,
because it can be handled easily in the `layer.parameter_step` method.
